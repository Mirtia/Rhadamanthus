# TODO

## Do not forget
- [ ] Use context pointer to pass the dispatcher and check if the VM is paused, if not, then the state checks should not continue as they may perform the checks in an inconsistent state.
- [ ] Add test for idt that modifies all vcpu IDT.
- [ ] Write down clean requirements from Obsidian.
